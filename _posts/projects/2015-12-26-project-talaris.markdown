## A test-bed for Moon robot testing .
TALARIS project was started at MIT space system laboratory. This system could hover up to several meters in the sky from the ground. It was a hovering test bed for testing and verifying the different functions of Lunar robot developed by MIT.

 In order to fly and land back on the ground, a very good sensor for orientation and altitude is needed, IMU is usually a good option. However, due to strong noise and vibration caused by the motor of the wings, IMU seems to be erroneous and inconsistent. In alternative to that, another sensor Laser distance sensors is considered.  The idea is to use four  line in sight laser sensors at four edges of the hover test-bed and find an algorithm to determine altitude and orientation for the test-bed while it is in the air. The obtained algorithm will be compared with the on-borad IMU sensors for its robustness in sensing the attitude of the hovering test-bed.



 Project Level: Undergraduate



 Project scope:

* Understand various coordinate system and transformation
* Understand the functioning of different sensors like distance sensors, Laser    sensors, IMU
* Write a communication protocol for Data acquisition from Sensors.
* Design and propose an algorithm to find the attitude of the robot by using the measurements of 4 laser sensors.

 Recommended background: Mechanical, Electronics/Eectrical, computer Science and similar



 What will you learn

 * Basics of Linear algebra and Coordinate transformation
 * Programming communication protocol.
 * Signal preprocessing and analysis
 * Learn and implement a very popular algorithm Least square algorithm


 NOTE: You will have access to the real experimental data from the Laser sensors and IMU sensors to test your algorithm.
